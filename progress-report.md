## Description
This file will track the progress we make in completing our project. We have four major deadlines: milestone 1 in Nov. 17, milestone 2 in Nov. 29, milestone 3 in Dec. 6, and final project in Dec. 12.

## Report
November 7th: Check out our project pitch here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14vtnmmRYquAEECtwGznRRNBs1waKNvSY1llARJxrtKg/

November 9th: Pushed CUDA/OpenGL boilerplate CMake project for us to build on.
November 12th: Referring to https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/projects/synthetic_silviculture/index.html to start creating the tree geometry data structures

November 13th: Referring to https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.4206&rep=rep1&type=pdf for help in representing graphs in the GPU

November 13-15th: Defining and implementing kernels and device functions for tree combustion and fluid solver.

November 16th: Merging tree combusion and fluid branches

November 20th: Working on integrating simulation 

November 23rd: Adding in test forest for us to run simulation on. Adding smoke and documenting code

November 24-27: Running simulation on test data, fixing simulation bugs, working on intrgrating simulation

November 28-29: Updating rendering for tree and smoke. Merged with render.

## TODOs
- Boilerplate code is using OpenGL 3.3. May want to figure out a way to move to OpenGL 4.6
- Work on tree and smoke rendering.
