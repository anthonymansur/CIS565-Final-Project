## Description
This file will track the progress we make in completing our project. We have four major deadlines: milestone 1 in Nov. 17, milestone 2 in Nov. 29, milestone 3 in Dec. 6, and final project in Dec. 12.

## Report
November 7th: Check out our project pitch here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14vtnmmRYquAEECtwGznRRNBs1waKNvSY1llARJxrtKg/

November 9th: Pushed CUDA/OpenGL boilerplate CMake project for us to build on.

## TODOs
- Boilerplate code is using OpenGL 3.3. May want to figure out a way to move to OpenGL 4.6
- Add to base code shaders and include a "hello world" square terrain with basic camera functionality.
- Start adding data structures needed for simulation (both for host and device)
